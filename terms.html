                    <p class="mb-6">
                        By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any
                        part

                    <p>
                        Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). You will be
                        billed
                        in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set either on
                        a
                        monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a
                        Subscription.
                    </p>

                    <p class="mt-4">
                        At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact
                        same
                        conditions unless you cancel it or XINGBO LIU. cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription
                        renewal either through your online account management page or by contacting XINGBO LIU.
                        customer support team.

                    <p class="mt-4">
                        A valid payment method, including credit card, is required to process the payment for your
                        Subscription. You shall provide XINGBO LIU. with accurate and complete billing information
                        including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and valid payment method
                        information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize XINGBO LIU.
                        to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.

                    <p class="mt-4">
                        Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, XINGBO LIU. will issue an electronic
                        invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full
                        payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.

                    <p>
                        XINGBO LIU. may, at its sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a free trial for a limited
                        period of time ("Free Trial").
                    </p>

                    <p class="mt-4">
                        You may be required to enter your billing information in order to sign up for the Free Trial.

                    <p class="mt-4">
                        If you do enter your billing information when signing up for the Free Trial, you will not be
                        charged by XINGBO LIU. until the Free Trial has expired. On the last day of the Free Trial
                        period, unless you cancelled your Subscription, you will be automatically charged the applicable
                        Subscription fees for the type of Subscription you have selected.
                    </p>

                    <p class="mt-4">
                        At any time and without notice, XINGBO LIU. reserves the right to (i) modify the terms and
                        conditions of the Free Trial offer, or (ii) cancel such Free Trial offer.

                        Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current
                        Billing Cycle.

                    <p class="mt-4">
                        XINGBO LIU. will provide you with reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees
                        to
                        give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.
                    </p>

                    <p class="mt-4">
                        Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect
                        constitutes
                        your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Refunds</h2>
                    <p>
                        Except when required by law, paid Subscription fees are non-refundable.
